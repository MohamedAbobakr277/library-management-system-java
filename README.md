Java Console-Based Library Management System
üìñ Project Overview
This is a simple but robust console-based application for managing a library's inventory and members. Built entirely in Java, this project demonstrates core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the practical application of common Data Structures. It allows users to manage books, track members, and handle borrowing and returning of books through a command-line interface.

This project was created to solidify my understanding of Java, OOP concepts, and data management without relying on external databases or frameworks.

‚ú® Core Features
Book Management: Add new books to the library catalog.

Member Management: Register new members with the library system.

Borrowing System: Allows registered members to check out available books. The system updates the book's status to unavailable.

Returning System: Allows members to return borrowed books, making them available again in the catalog.

View Catalog: Display a list of all books in the library along with their current availability status.

Interactive Console UI: A straightforward menu-driven interface for easy navigation and use.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts Used
Programming Language: Java

Core Concepts:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Encapsulation: Data for Book and Member are kept private and accessed via public methods.

Abstraction: Objects like Library, Book, and Member model real-world entities.

Data Structures:

HashMap: Used for efficient, constant-time O(1) lookups of books and members by their unique IDs.

ArrayList: Used within the Member class to manage the list of books each member has borrowed.

Development Environment:

IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

Java Development Kit (JDK)

üöÄ How to Run the Project
You can run this project from any Java-compatible IDE or directly from the command line.

Prerequisites:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed.

Steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system-java.git](https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system-java.git)

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd library-management-system-java/src 

(Or wherever your .java files are located)

Compile the Java files:

javac *.java

This will compile all the .java files into .class files.

Run the main application:

java Main

You should now see the application menu running in your console.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Here are some ideas for future improvements to this project:

Data Persistence: Save the library's state to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) so that data isn't lost when the application closes.

Advanced Search: Implement functionality to search for books by title or author, not just by ID.

Due Dates and Fines: Add a due date for borrowed books and calculate fines for overdue returns.

Improved Error Handling: Add more specific error messages for different scenarios (e.g., "Member not found," "Book already borrowed").
